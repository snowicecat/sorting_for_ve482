#sorting_for_void_type-int-double-char-

>The goal of this exercise is to improve the programming skills and get more familiar with pointers and function pointers.
1. Implement a linked list structure containing two pointers of type char and void, respectively. It should be possible to add (remove) elements to (from) the list.
2. Knowing that the void pointer in the structure could contain some char, int, or double, write a search function for this linked list.
3. The linked list will store elements read from an ASCII file where each line is in the format somestring=somedata. The type of the data is defined in the filename; for instance a file containing unsorted integers will be named rand int.txt. Implement the necessary functions to read and write such files.
4. Use a function pointers to compare and sort the elements from the structure with respect to the data field. Implement the following sorting orders: increasing, decreasing, and random. The filename is sortingtype dataype.txt, where sortingtype is rand, inc, or dec.
5. Write a function to test the implementation.
